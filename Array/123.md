Say you have an array for which the _i_<sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most _two_ transactions.

**Note: **You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>`

#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int buy1 = -prices[0];
        int sell1 = 0;
        int buy2 = INT_MIN;
        int sell2 = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i<prices.size();i++){
            buy1 = max(buy1, -prices[i]);
            sell1 = max(sell1, prices[i] + buy1);
            buy2 = max(buy2, sell1-prices[i]);
            sell2 = max(sell2, prices[i]+buy2);
        }
        return sell2;
    }
};
```
