### [435\. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

Difficulty: **Medium**

Related Topics: [Greedy](https://leetcode.com/tag/greedy/)

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

**Note:**

1.  You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
2.  Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
private:
    static bool comp(const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b){
        return a[0] < b[0];
    }
public:
    int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& ins) {
        if (ins.empty())
            return {};
        vector<int> prev;
        sort(ins.begin(), ins.end(), comp);
        prev = ins[0];
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < ins.size(); i++) {
            if (ins[i][0] < prev[1]) {
                count++;
                if (ins[i][1] < prev[1])
                    prev = ins[i];
            }
            else prev = ins[i];
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
